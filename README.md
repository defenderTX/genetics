A golang demo which explores evolutionary algorithms to generate an equation which solves to a given integer.

## Why?
I originally started this project in 2015 to learn the go programming language and a little about generative AI at the same time. At the time, I followed a tutorial on genetic (evolutionary) algorithms with all code examples written in Java and ported the code to go. I've since revisited the project and refactored the original code to be more go idiomatic. The entire project is simply for fun and education.
